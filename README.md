# 100 Days of Python Code

## Overview

This repository contains my journey through the 100 Days of Python Code challenge. The challenge involves coding in Python for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days. This README serves as a logbook to track my progress, document my learnings, and showcase the projects I work on during this period.

## Motivation

The main goals of participating in the 100 Days of Python Code challenge are:

- To build a strong foundation in Python programming language.
- To enhance my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
- To develop practical projects and applications using Python.
- To establish a consistent coding habit.

## Rules

The rules for the 100 Days of Python Code challenge are simple:

1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfPython hashtag.
3. Encourage and support fellow participants in the community.

## Progress Log

I'll update my progress regularly in this section. Below is a summary of my progress so far:

- [Day 1](logs/day1.md): Started with Python basics, covered variables, data types, and basic operations.
- [Day 2](logs/day2.md): Explored control flow statements - if, else, and loops.
- [Day 3](logs/day3.md): Learned about functions and practiced writing simple functions.
- [Day 4](logs/day4.md): Dived into data structures - lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

Feel free to explore detailed logs in the [logs](logs/) directory.

## Projects

During this challenge, I'll work on various Python projects to apply the concepts I've learned and build real-world applications. Here are some of the projects I plan to work on:

1. **To-Do List Application:** A simple command-line to-do list manager.
2. **Weather App:** Fetches weather information based on user input.
3. **Web Scraper:** Scrapes data from websites and saves it to a file.
4. **Basic Flask App:** Develop a basic web application using Flask framework.

I'll update this section with project details and links as I progress through the challenge.

## Resources

To support my learning journey, I'll utilize various resources including:

- Online tutorials and courses
- Official Python documentation
- Python programming books
- Coding exercises and challenges
